The main focus is to overcome the high latencies associated with the conventional communication protocol stack management of TCP/IP. The LLM provides a transport protocol that offers high reliability at the fragment level keeping the acknowledgment overhead low given the high reliability levels of the LAN. The system utilizes some of the architectural facilities provided by the Linux kernel specially designed for optimization in the respective areas. Reliability against fragment losses is ensured by using a low overhead negative acknowledgment scheme. The implementation is in the form of loadable modules extending the Linux OS. In a typical implementation on a cluster of two nodes, each of uniprocessor Intel Pentium 400 MHz on a 10/100 Mbps LAN achieved an average round trip latency of .169ms as compared to the .531ms obtained by ICMP (Ping) protocol. A relative comparison of LLM with others is also provided.",HiPC 2552,VP89666

This new analytical technology has the potential to identify disease associated proteomic patterns in blood serum.

Aim: Find, analyze and compare serum proteom patterns in groups of human subjects having different properties such as disease status with a new workflow to enhance sensitivity and specificity. Problems: Mass data acquired from high-throughput platforms frequently are blurred and noisy.

Results: A new analysis workflow has been developed that is able to accurately identify, analyze and determine peaks and their parameters even below noise level which other tools can not detect.

The rule induction is based on creating agents within the main modeling processes. This method is suitable for qualitative information and also takes into account user preferences. Furthermore, we designed an incremental architecture for addressing dynamic database problems of rough set-based rule induction, making it unnecessary to re-compute the whole dataset when the database is updated. As a result, huge degrees of computation time and memory space are saved when executing IRSRIA. Finally, we apply our method to a case study of a cell phone purchase.

While this engine is biased toward the efficient execution of fork-join parallelism in shared memory, it handles the full X10 language, especially conditional atomic blocks and distribution. We show that this engine improves the run time of a series of benchmark programs by several orders of magnitude when used in combination with the C++ backend compiler and runtime for X10.

To meet this challenge, both have attempted to enhance their position by adding significant new features to their language. For example, APL2 is an extension of APL.Fortran has also attempted to meet the challenges of modern programming by developing a new Fortran standard called Fortran 90. This standard revises many areas of Fortran, but this paper will only concentrate on those that affect the computational power of Fortran. Many of the changes were motivated by the increased use of vector and array supercomputers. Therefore, array features, the ability to act on entire arrays instead of individual elements, are an important part of this new standard. In doing this work, the Fortran community looked to APL as an example of a powerful array language.This paper will answer several questions regarding this new standard. First, from a computational or functional point of view, what are the major features of Fortran 90? Next, how do these features compare with APL2? And finally, what can APL2 learn from the Fortran 90 work?",APL 21,VP88517

Fast Fourier transform (FFT), computing intensive and bandwidth intensive, is one of the most popular and important applications in the world. Compared with the computing resource on multicore architecture, the on-chip memory resource is much more expensive because of the limitation of physical chip size. Efficient implementation of FFT algorithm on multicore with good scalability is a challenge for both software and hardware developers.

In this paper we propose a feature-based classification approach to classify real-world multivariate time series generated by drilling rig sensors in the oil and gas industry. Our approach encompasses two main phases: representation and classification. For the representation phase, we propose a novel representation of time series which combines trend-based and value-based approximations (we abbreviate it as TVA). It produces a compact representation of the time series which consists of symbolic strings that represent the trends and the values of each variable in the series. The TVA representation improves both the accuracy and the running time of the classification process by extracting a set of informative features suitable for common classifiers. For the classification phase, we propose a memory-based classifier which takes into account the antecedent results of the classification process. The inputs of the proposed classifier are the TVA features computed from the current segment, as well as the predicted class of the previous segment.

Attractor selection is an algorithm that searches for a stable state flexibly under changing environments. To apply attractor selection to a scheduling field, a scheduling framework based on scheduling strategy using a dispatching rule is introduced. A scheduling problem solution is scheduled by repeated applications of a prepared dispatching rule with plural strategies. The rule has a parameter that controls scheduling strategies based on the current “environment,” which means kinds, amounts, and remaining to due of jobs, machine conditions, etc. Attracter selection controls the parameters under changing environments.

The rule has a parameter that controls scheduling strategies based on the current “environment,” which means kinds, amounts, and remaining to due of jobs, machine conditions, etc. Attracter selection controls the parameters under changing environments. The proposed framework was applied to a real-time production scheduling problem, and the optimality of the parameters of the strategy and followup ability were considerd when environmental changes occur.",BioADIT 3853,VP83367

In this paper we present a technique for tuning the amount of data presented to the user, directly inspired to the concept of Levels of Details (LoD), commonly used in computer graphics.

This requires body conformal antennas with a power distribution as homogeneous as possible over the skin area. The contact flexible microstrip applicators (CFMA) operating at 434 MHz exist in several sizes, including the large size 3H and 5H. This paper investigates the behavior of the electromagnetic fields for the 3H and 5H CFMA in both flat and curved configurations, and the impact on performance parameters like the penetration depth (PD) and the effective heating depth (EHD). The underlying theory behind the electromagnetic behavior in curved situations is presented as well as numerical simulations of both flat and curved configurations. The results are compared to measurements of the electromagnetic field distributions in a cylindrical patient model. Due to their large size multimode solutions may exist, and our results confirm their existence. These multimode solutions affect both the power distribution and PD/EHD, with a dependence on applicator curvature. Therefore, the performance parameters like PD and EHD need to be carefully assessed when bending large size CFMA applicators to conform to the patient body.

The paper proposes an exact (MTNIP-E) and an approximating model (MPNIM) to solve this NP-hard problem and presents computational results to compare the models. MTNIP-E is obtained by first formulating MTNIP as bi-level min–max program and then converting it into a mixed integer program where the flow is explicitly minimized. MPNIM is binary-integer program that does not minimize the flow directly. It partitions the node set into disjoint subsets such that each node group is in a different subset and minimizes the sum of the arc capacities crossing between different subsets. Computational results show that MPNIM can solve all instances in a few seconds while MTNIP-E cannot solve about one third of the problems in 24hour. The optimal objective function values of both models are equal to each other for some problems while they differ from each other as much as 46.2% in the worst case. However, when the post-interdiction flow capacity incurred by the solution of MPNIM is computed and compared to the objective value of MTNIP-E, the largest difference is only 7.90% implying that MPNIM may be a very good approximation to MTNIP-E.",European Journal of Operational Research 211,VP81310

In one DNA segment the native guanines at nucleotides positions 17 and 19 were replaced with two 8-oxoguanines (8-oxoG) (8-oxoG is mutagenic DNA oxo-lesion). The analysis of results was focused on the electrostatic energy that is supposed to be significant factor causing the disruption of DNA base stacking in DNA duplex and may also serve as a signal toward the repair enzyme informing the presence of the lesion. The repulsive interaction between 8-oxoG and the entire DNA molecule was observed, which caused the extrahelical position of 8-oxoG (position 19). The repulsive electrostatic interaction between both 8-oxoG lesions contributed to the flipping out of one 8-oxoG and to the local instability of the lesioned DNA region. The electrostatic potential at the surface of DNA close to the lesions has more negative value than the same region on the native DNA. This electrostatic potential may signal presence of the lesion to the repair enzyme. In the simulation of native DNA segment, no significant structural changes were observed and B-DNA structure was well preserved throughout the MD simulation.",No,No

The model can compute the total reflectance at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) according to observation conditions of satellites, based on a radiative transfer model with the consideration of multiple scattering effects and atmospheric absorption effects. The performance of the HRSREM model was examined by Gordon’s algorithms, showing that the relative errors of the Rayleigh scattering reflectance and the aerosol scattering reflectance are less than 2%. The model can also compute the sky reflectance which can be validated by in-situ measurements. The two sky reflectances match well with a spectral average error of 5.4%. The relative error of the total reflectance of the model, verified by sea-viewing wide field-of-view sensor (SeaWiFS) data, is about 3.5%. Therefore, the total reflectances at TOA, computed by the model, can be taken as reference values to evaluate the accuracy of satellite reflectances. The model was used to evaluate the accuracy of the hypersptral satellite (Hyperion) remote sensing data.

The model can compute the total reflectance at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) according to observation conditions of satellites, based on a radiative transfer model with the consideration of multiple scattering effects and atmospheric absorption effects. The performance of the HRSREM model was examined by Gordon’s algorithms, showing that the relative errors of the Rayleigh scattering reflectance and the aerosol scattering reflectance are less than 2%. The model can also compute the sky reflectance which can be validated by in-situ measurements. The two sky reflectances match well with a spectral average error of 5.4%. The relative error of the total reflectance of the model, verified by sea-viewing wide field-of-view sensor (SeaWiFS) data, is about 3.5%. Therefore, the total reflectances at TOA, computed by the model, can be taken as reference values to evaluate the accuracy of satellite reflectances. The model was used to evaluate the accuracy of the hypersptral satellite (Hyperion) remote sensing data. The Hyperion reflectance matches the total reflectance of HRSREM very well at visible and near-infrared bands with an average error of 7.3%, while the status of calibration coefficients at shortwave infrared bands are not stable with a large spectral average error of 63.5%. The reflectance evaluation of a moderate resolution imaging spectrometer (CMODIS) data indicated that relative errors are large, especially at near-infrared bands with relative errors more than 100%. The calibration coefficients of CMODIS, obtained from laboratory measurements, are not reliable. The CMODIS data should be recalibrated for oceanographic applications.

An analysis of the knowledge management literature within information science journals shows a need for a wider academic perspective and a more philosophically grounded one. As the current knowledge management discourse is fragmented, we propose an integrative, interdisciplinary framework that would be useful for resituating knowledge management among scholars and practitioners. The principal pillars of this theoretical framework are organizational learning; systems and technology; and culture and strategy. Current criticisms of the knowledge management discourse are closely examined. The notions of knowledge sharing, social capital and organizational learning processes provide fundamental insights into knowledge management.

In doing so, a series of processes that serve to heighten the intensity of cameras in this already saturated video surveillance landscape are occurring. At the same time, these developments, whilst affecting East London, demonstrate a number of key issues, debates and crises germane to the dissemination and operation of video surveillance across the UK as a whole. These include the intensification and cohesion of video surveillance networks; the role of CCTV in urban regeneration schemes; tensions between disparate applications of CCTV and aspirations for a coherent regulatory framework; and, crucially, how CCTV can be justified at a time of severe economic crisis. The paper explores these issues via the identification and analysis of three broad processes operating in East London: the 'additionality' of Olympic-related surveillance measures; the centripetal surveillance-pull of Olympic-related regeneration programmes; and the co-option and integration of extant CCTV facilities. The strong emphasis on surveillant economies of scale and the integration of existing surveillance infrastructures invite reflection on post-Foucauldian theorisations of networked 'societies of control'.",No,No

Network and Computer Applications,2011,Journal,34,RV68558,Savannah Walker,RV70303,Michael Mccarty,H31438,qffvkjiptv,Editor,AR47199,traditional access control,R54215,Accepted,"Operating systems traditionally use access control mechanisms to manage access to system resources like files, network connections, and memory areas. However, classic access control models are not suitable for regulating access to the diversity of ways data is available and used today. Modern usage control models go beyond traditional access control, addressing its limitations related to attribute mutability and continuous usage permission validation. The recently proposed UCONABC model establishes a predicate-based framework to satisfy the new access/usage control needs in computing systems. This paper defines a usage control model based on UCONABC and describes a framework to implement it in an operating system kernel, on top of the existing DAC mechanism. A language for representing usage control entities and rules is also proposed, and some typical access/usage control scenarios are represented using it, to show its usefulness. Finally, a prototype of the proposed framework was built in an operating system kernel, to control the usage of local files. The prototype evaluation shows that the proposed model is feasible, straightforward, and may serve as a basis for more complex usage control frameworks.",J.

Can these drawbacks be counteracted by fractionally counting citation weights instead of using whole numbers in the numerators? (a) Fractional citation counts are normalized in terms of the citing sources and thus would take into account differences in citation behavior among fields of science. (b) Differences in the resulting distributions can be tested statistically for their significance at different levels of aggregation. (c) Fractional counting can be generalized to any document set including journals or groups of journals, and thus the significance of differences among both small and large sets can be tested. A list of fractionally counted IFs for 2008 is available online at The between-group variance among the 13 fields of science identified in the U.S. Science and Engineering Indicators is no longer statistically significant after this normalization.

We consider a class of CPGs modeled by a set of interconnected identical neurons. Based on the idea of multivariable harmonic balance, we show how the oscillation profile is related to the connectivity matrix that specifies the architecture and strengths of the interconnections. Specifically, the frequency, amplitudes, and phases are essentially encoded in terms of a pair of eigenvalue and eigenvector. This basic principle is used to estimate the oscillation profile of a given CPG model. Moreover, a systematic method is proposed for designing a CPG-based nonlinear oscillator that achieves a prescribed oscillation profile.",No,No

Perceptual modes of presentation are important because they help resolve a tension in current work on consciousness. Philosophers are pulled by three mutually inconsistent theses: representational externalism, representationalism, and phenomenal internalism. I throw my hat in with defenders of the first two: the externalist representationalists. We are faced with the problem of explaining away intuitions that favor phenomenal internalism. Perceptual modes of presentation account for what it is like to see properties in a way that accommodates those intuitions without vindicating phenomenal internalism itself. Perceptual MoPs therefore provide a new way of being an externalist representationalist.",No,No

The objective herein is to design an agent-based model to analyze the conditions that need to be met for the diffusion of green management into SMEs. Our model belongs to the agent-based models related to the diffusion of innovation. One remarkable feature of the basic model is that it includes two related markets for a product and its component, in which there are transactions between consumers and Large Enterprises (LEs) and between LEs and SMEs. Although the basic model is not concerned with a specific product, settings of the model are based on the existing empirical researches on SMEs in machine & metal and plastic processing industries. Simulation results of the basic model reveal effective strategies of enterprises. LEs which raise eco-levels faster than others can acquire profits. SMEs which lower prices faster than others can also improve financial resource. The sensitivity analysis shows that the cost condition is an important factor for the diffusion of green management into SMEs. We suggest that knowledge support to SMEs can take a role in order to reduce environmental cost, based on the results of previous empirical research. An applied model concerning knowledge support is also presented. Simulation results of the applied model reveal that information provision from the external organizations to SMEs could be effective for the diffusion of green management.",No,No
